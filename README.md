# FilterLists-AAK
##### Project Status: May no longer be necessary // On hold
**Clarified Purpose:** Additional test / experimental rules for blocking anti-adblockers and their code on affected websites.

**Update Dec 2024:** I'm monitoring the current status and need of this filter. More filters is not more; doing more with less is always the best decision. As of late 2024, it seems anti-adblocker APIs have shifted their approach, where in the past they enforced nag screens without a way to bypass them, causing users to bounce (exit) the site, they are all now including bypass links below the nag screens. This new decision is likely due to a significant negative affect that undismissable nag screens costed the affected sites.
